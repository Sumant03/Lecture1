 QWhat are the major features of React?
The major features of React are:

It uses VirtualDOM instead of RealDOM considering that RealDOM manipulations are expensive.
Supports server-side rendering.
Follows Unidirectional data flow or data binding.
Uses reusable/composable UI components to develop the view.






QWhat is state in React?
State of a component is an object that holds some information that may change over the lifetime of the component. We should always try to make our state as simple as possible and minimize the number of stateful components.

Let's create a user component with message state,

class User extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props)

    this.state = {
      message: 'Welcome to React world'
    }
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>{this.state.message}</h1>
      </div>
    )
  }
}
